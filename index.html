  <center><h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <h2>I am <i>PrimalPeashooter</i>, or <u>Primal</u> for short. Nice to meet you!</h2>
  This is my first website, so no fancy CSS or Java (yet!). Just plain HTML like 1999.</center>

  <h2>Biodata</h2>
  <table cellspacing="0">
   <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>I'm an 05' teen, and I don't mind any pronouns. I was born Malaysian, and I'm currently studying in college. I'm taking pure science major. My goals in the future is to study agriculture, even though my parents don't prefer that to be my major. I also intend to have art as my second thing, more than a hobby.<br>
    My Myers-Briggs code is ENTP, and I've been diagnosed with both Autism and Attention Deficit Disorder. Doesn't stop me from pushing on!<br>
    I'm pretty lax about many things and chill to hang out with. I tend to go into pretty deep philosophical/science talk though if prompted. I try to keep things casual.<br>
    I have a lover, however she is not ready to step into the light yet. Our relationship is still private.<br>
    Other than art, I love reading books, gaming, and cycling.</td>

  <h2>My Art</h2>
  My art is mostly digital art aimed towards members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom" target=_blank>Furry Fandom</a>. This means that you won't see a lot of humans in my art, mostly anthropomorphic characters. I still do draw humans though, to balance it out.<br>
  I draw using an old Trust tablet I got from my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/thefox1810" target=_blank>@Skitfox18</a> from Romania. It works like a charm! My preferred drawing program is <a href="https://firealpaca.com/" target=_blank>FireAlpaca</a> and I draw on a Dell Inspiron laptop. Here are some examples of my work: (pending - add images)
